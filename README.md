# Beehive / Ant Farm — Living Generative Simulation

A contemplative browser-based ecosystem where bees and ants self-organize, forage, adapt, and clash in emergent swarm behavior.

## Run

1. Open a terminal in this folder.
2. Start a static server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000 --bind 127.0.0.1
```

3. Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000` in your browser.

You can also open `index.html` directly, but a local server is recommended.

## Interaction

- **Click**: drop food into the ecosystem.
- **Right-click**: create a temporary danger zone that repels and stresses nearby swarms.

## What to watch

- Dynamic strategy shifts (scouting, defensive clustering, aggressive expansion, war waves).
- Pheromone-like fading trails and soft additive glow rendering.
- Procedural food ecology and a subtle day/night palette cycle.
